# Classes and Inheritance

## Objects
* C++ is an object-oriented programming language, so everything within it is associated with classes and objects, along with attributes and methods for the object
  * An example of an object in real life could be a pet cat -- the cat is the object, where it has attributes such as color and size, and methods such as eating and sleeping
* In C++, an object is created from a class

### Naming conventions 
* Naming conventions are not requirements for the language to run, but rather the "norm" of what its users are naming the entities in C++

#### General naming conventions
* No use of all upper case abbreviations (e.g., WeightLbs instead of WeightLBS)

#### Class names
* Name the class after what it is (e.g., Cat)
* CamelCase as word separaters (e.g., MonsterTruck)
* No underscores (e.g., NOT hello_world)

#### Method and function names
* Be explicit about what a function or method is doing (e.g., `PrintName()` rather than `Print()`)


#### Class attribute names
* Private attribute names should begin with a lowercase `m` (e.g., private: int mCatAge)
* The `m` comes before other name modifiers like `p` for pointer (e.g., *mpName)


#### Variable names
* Lowercase letters only
* Underscore `_` is used as the word separator (e.g., cat_in_the_hat)
